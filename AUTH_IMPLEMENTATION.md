## 📋 Backend Changes

### ✅ `backend/src/middleware/auth.ts`

## 🔒 Security Features

### ✅ JWT Token Verification
- All API requests validated with Supabase
- Expired tokens automatically rejected
- Invalid tokens return 401 errors

### ✅ Protected Routes
- Users must be logged in to access app
- Automatic redirect to login if not authenticated
- Session persists across app restarts

### ✅ User Isolation
- Each user only sees their own data
- Backend verifies user ID from token
- Cannot access other users' projects/pages

## 🧪 How to Test

### Step 1: Start Your Backend
```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

You should see: `✅ Supabase connected successfully`

### Step 2: Reset Your App
Since we changed authentication, you'll need to start fresh:
```bash
# Clear app data on your phone
# Or reinstall Expo Go
```

### Step 3: Run Your App
```bash
npx expo start
```

### Step 4: Test Authentication Flow

#### **A) Sign Up (New User)**
1. App opens to Sign In screen (you're not logged in)
2. Tap "Sign Up"
3. Enter email: `test@example.com`
4. Enter password: `password123`
5. Confirm password: `password123`
6. Tap "Sign Up"
7. Should see success message
8. Auto-redirected to app home screen ✅

#### **B) Sign Out**
1. Go to Settings tab
2. Scroll to "Account" section
3. See your email displayed
4. Tap "Sign Out"
5. Confirm
6. Redirected to Sign In screen ✅

#### **C) Sign In (Existing User)**
1. On Sign In screen
2. Enter email: `test@example.com`
3. Enter password: `password123`
4. Tap "Sign In"
5. Redirected to app home screen ✅

#### **D) Session Persistence**
1. Sign in
2. Force close app
3. Reopen app
4. Should still be logged in ✅

#### **E) Create Projects**
1. Sign in as user A
2. Create a project
3. Sign out
4. Sign in as user B
5. Shouldn't see user A's project ✅

## 🔧 Supabase Dashboard Setup

### Enable Email Auth (If Not Already)
1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Go to **Authentication** → **Providers**
4. Make sure **Email** is enabled
5. Optional: Disable email confirmation for testing
   - Go to **Authentication** → **Settings**
   - Turn OFF "Enable email confirmations"
   - (Makes testing faster - users don't need to verify email)

---

## 📝 What About Your Existing Test User?

Your old test user ID (`39fcd9b8-7c1b-41b1-8980-931a616ead82`) won't work anymore. 

**That's OK!** Here's why:
- Old approach: Everyone used same fake user ID
- New approach: Real users with real accounts
- Each student testing your app will create their own account
- Their data is separate and secure

---

## 🎯 For Your User Testing (2 Weeks)

### Option 1: Pre-create Test Accounts
If you want students to use specific accounts:

1. Sign up accounts manually now:
   - `student1@test.com` / `password123`
   - `student2@test.com` / `password123`
   - etc.

2. Give each student their credentials

### Option 2: Let Students Sign Up
Students create their own accounts during testing:

1. Share your published app
2. Students tap "Sign Up"
3. Use their email (or test emails)
4. They create their own accounts

**Recommendation:** Option 2 is easier and tests the real flow!

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "No authorization token provided"
- User not logged in
- Session expired
- Clear app data and sign in again

### "Supabase connection failed"
- Check backend .env file has `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
- Check Supabase project is active
- Check internet connection

### "Invalid email or password"
- Check credentials
- Make sure user account exists
- Try signing up again

### App stuck on login screen
- Check backend is running
- Check network connection
- Check backend logs for errors

### Can't create account
- Email might already be registered
- Check Supabase Auth dashboard for user list
- Try different email

## 📊 Check Your Users

To see all registered users:
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard
2. Go to **Authentication** → **Users**
3. See list of all accounts
4. Can manually delete test users if needed

---

## 🎓 What's Next?

Your authentication is **production-ready**! You can now:

1. ✅ **Test locally** with real user accounts
2. ✅ **Deploy with ngrok** for user testing (works with auth!)
3. ✅ **Deploy to Railway** for final presentation (no changes needed!)
4. ✅ **Each student** gets their own account and data

---

## 💡 Summary

**You now have:**
- ✅ Real user authentication (not fake test users)
- ✅ Secure JWT token validation
- ✅ Beautiful login/signup screens
- ✅ Session persistence
- ✅ User data isolation
- ✅ Sign out functionality
- ✅ Production-ready code

**Done right the first time!** No need to revise later. 🎉
